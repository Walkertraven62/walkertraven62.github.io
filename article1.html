        <h2>Navi Wins CS2 Paris Major</h2>
        <p>The inaugural Counter-Strike 2 Major in Copenhagen, Denmark has been won by NAVI, who defeated FaZe Clan 2-1 in the championship match.

With this victory, NAVI becomes the first-ever CS:GO global champion, but they had also won the CS:GO Stockholm Major in 2021, thus they are not new to the top of the Counter-Strike scene. The final was really a repeat of the Antwerp Major final, in which FaZe and NAVI faced off in the grand final back in 2022â€”though FaZe prevailed that time.</p>
